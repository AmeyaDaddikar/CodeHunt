    There were clues and references all around the questions, <br/>
    you can ask us for the <i>behind the scenes</i> codes, or you can try decompiling this app.<br/>
    (If you had decompiled the app in the beginning, you could have won the competition in 1 minute!!)<br/>
        If this event created an incentive within you towards liking coding, do approach us!!! We would be happy to
        share even more about the world of development, competitive coding, and a heck lot more !!
